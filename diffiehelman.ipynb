    "\n",
    "Wiki: Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange is a mathematical method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as conceived by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography. Published in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman, this is the earliest publicly known work that proposed the idea of a private key and a corresponding public key. \n",

    "In short it is a scheme for two participants, each with a private key and a public key to produce the same combined key without revealing their private keys i.e. by only combining their private key to their partners public key:\n",
