    "## Shamirs Secret Sharing\n",

    "\n",
    "Wiki: Shamir's secret sharing (SSS) is an efficient secret sharing algorithm for distributing private information (the \"secret\") among a group so that the secret cannot be revealed unless a quorum of the group acts together to pool their knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short it works by deciding on a secret (i.e. a number), lets call it $S$, and defining a polynomial of some degree $y$ s.t. $y(0) = S$. The degree of the polynomial will decide how many participants are needed to recover the secret, for example if three are needed then $y$ needs to be of degree two. Then a number of points along the curve is generated and they can be used to determine the curve, and thus be traced back to the secret."

    "\n",
    "We define the generating function, which distributes a number of secret-shares or points in the plane. In this example we decide that to recover the secret we need to have three participants. This means that the function will generate a polynomial y of degree two:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It will then produce $p$ points along the polynomial. In the example below we set $p=5$. This means that 3 of the total 5 can collaborate to reconstruct the polynomial, since there is only one such curve that passes through all points. For a simpler example, imagine the polynomial being a line, $y(x) = ax + b$. Then only two participants is needed to reconstruct the polynomial, since for a pair of points there exists one unique line that passes through it."
